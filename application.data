The DC to hear you is 25 before the attack and 5 after the attack. The DC to spot you is 35 (25 + 10 for total concealment) before the attack and 15 (25 - 20 for attacking + 10 for total concealment) after the attack.\nExample 7: You try to snipe on a target from good cover and a distance of 30 squares; let us say you get a total skill check of 25 (counting d20 + skill + Dex mod) for both Hide and Move Silently. The DC to hear you is 50 (25 + 10 for stationary + 15 for distance) before the attack and 20 (25 - 20 for attacking + 15 for distance) after the attack. The DC to spot you is 44 (25 + 5 for stationary + 8 for good cover + 6 for distance) before the attack and 19 (25 - 20 for attacking + 8 for good cover + 6 for distance) after the attack.
