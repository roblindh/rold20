<h4>Land Ownership</h4>
<p>
    Most D&amp;D campaigns are based on a feudal system roughly similar to medieval Europe.
    In essence, this means that land ownership starts with an emperor, empress, king, or queen and then
    propagates down through a hierarchy of vassals. A feudal lord will typically split his land into
    parcels and grant rights to those parcels to his vassals. A vassal has the right
    to farm, mine, or otherwise exploit that land as he chooses. The vassal then pays tax to the lord,
    usually as a percentage of any income earned from the land, in exchange for protection and possibly
    other services provided by the lord.
</p>
<p>
    Farming and mining are not the only types of income a lord can extract from his land. Tolls from
    roads, tariffs from ports, and taxes from city guilds are other common examples. Whether these
    incomes belong to the local lord or not varies from kingdom to kingdom, but in many cases
    roads, ports, and cities are considered the sole property (and responsibility) of the highest levels
    in the feudal hierarchy, such as a duke or the king.
</p>
<p>
    In most feudal systems, it is quite common for a lord to occupy multiple levels in the feudal
    hierarchy. For example, members of the royal family are usually dukes and duchesses of the kingdom's
    most important duchies, counts and countesses of the key counties in those duchies, and so forth.
    A side effect of this is that a king or queen is usually able to grant land and titles from their own
    holdings without having to first revoke those titles from existing vassals.
</p>
<p>
    In most feudal systems, titles and land ownership is hereditary, but there are exceptions to this rule.
    There are some historical examples where ownership automatically reverted to the lord after a set amount
    of time or when the vassal died.

<h3 id="Trading">Trading and Economy</h3>
<p>
    In most civilized areas, trade is regulated by the local rulers and guilds.
    This means that most coins and bars of precious metals have well-defined and constant values,
    regardless of whether they are used for buying or selling. Gems, art objects, and certain trade goods
    that are commonly used for bartering also have well-regulated values, leaving little room for haggling.
</p>
<p>
    Manufactured goods, on the other hand, can vary a lot more in quality, condition, and price.
    The price listed in the 
    <a href="hb12_equipment.php">equipment lists</a> 
    is the typical price someone has to pay to buy the item from a merchant or craftsman.
    On the other hand, when a character (or other non-merchant) tries to sell such an item, the typical price is no more than 50% of the listed price.
</p>
<p>
    Most towns will also have a black market, which can be used to discreetly buy or sell illegal equipment and stolen goods.
    However, the risk involved has a negative effect on prices â€“ when buying something through a black market,
    you typically pay 200% of the listed price, and when selling, you rarely get more than 25% of the listed price.
</p>
<p>
    For some items, renting or borrowing can be an option. The typical cost should be 5% of the listed price per day,
    but this can vary a lot based on the perceived risk of damages to, destruction of, or theft of the equipment.
</p>

<h4>Coins and Gems</h4>
<p>
    For player characters, wealth usually comes in the form of coins. Most common coins are 3 to 4 cm in diameter and weigh 10 g.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Copper Pieces (cp):</em> The least valuable common coin. 10 cp equal 1 sp.<br/>
    <em>Silver Pieces (sp):</em> For commoners, this is the most prevalent coin. 10 sp equal 1 gp.
    To get a feel for the worth of a silver piece, it buys approximately as much as 10 US$ in the year 2000.<br/>
    <em>Gold Pieces (gp):</em> The coin of choice for wealthy individuals. 10 gp equal 1 pp.<br/>
    <em>Platinum Pieces (pp):</em> The rarest and most valuable of the common coins.
    It can be found in ancient treasure hoards but is seldom minted or used in daily life.
</p>
<p>
    Merchants and caravans often use trade bars as well as coins.
    Most trade bars are silver or gold, and they come in 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 kg weights.
    See the trade goods table for the value per weight of trade bars.
</p>

<h4>Banks</h4>
<p>
    Towns will usually have one or more moneychangers.
    Their main service is to exchange coins and trade bars of different value, weight, and origin,
    and they charge a portion of that wealth for the work done.
    Larger towns and cities will have wealthier moneychangers, offering extended services.
    These services can include storage of money, transfer of money to other cities and countries,
    offering loans, and brokering investment opportunities.
</p>

<h4>Trade Fairs</h4>
<p>
    Medieval civilizations tend to have regular trade fairs, where both local and traveling
    merchants and craftsmen gather to buy and sell their wares.
    They also act as festivals for common folk, attracting entertainers as well as pickpockets.
    Trade fairs are large and messy affairs, commonly held outdoors, and they can often last for one or two weeks at a time.

<h4>Tournaments</h4>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Melee: Battle between multiple knights simultaneously. "Last man standing".</li>
    <li>Team: Two or more teams fight each other simultaneously.</li>
    <li>List: One knight against another. Opponents can be selected randomly or by challenge.</li>
    <li>Pageant: Teams compete for a quest-like objective.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Most tournaments focus on jousting. In a typical joust, unhorsed knights may choose to continue the fight with their sword (or other melee weapon).
</p>
<p>
    Tournament prices can be up to several thousand gold pieces for the really big tournaments.
</p>

<h4>Spell Duels</h4>
<p>
    From time to time, wizards and other spellcasters agree to meet in formal duels rather than fight it out in the chaos of regular battles.
    A set of ancient and honorable rules has evolved over time to resolve such conflicts in a relatively fair manner.
    Note, however, that no magic automatically enforces compliance, and dishonorable spellcasters can and do break the rules.
</p>
<p>
    Typical ground rules and prerequisites:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most spell duels are one-against-one affairs, taking place between two single spellcasters without companions, familiars, etc.</li>
    <li>The two duelists agree on a time and place, but the challenged party is traditionally given the choice of dueling ground.</li>
    <li>The two duelists agree on whether the duel will be lethal or nonlethal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Dueling procedure:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Neither party may be under the effect of active spells or magic items at the start of the duel.</li>
    <li>At the appointed time, the presiding judge or official gives a sign that the duel has begun. The participants roll initiative.</li>
    <li>Round 1: The participants may only cast spells that target themselves.</li>
    <li>Round 2: The participants may cast spells that target themselves, and they may also prepare one spell as a "ready action".</li>
    <li>Round 3+: The participants may cast any spell or spells, resolve their readied actions (if any), and generally act freely.</li>
    <li>End of duel: The duel traditionally ends when one combatant yields, dies, is knocked unconscious, or otherwise rendered unable to continue.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="SocialCharacteristics">Using Social Characteristics</h3>

<h4 id="SocialClass">Social Class</h4>
<p>
    Social Class is a measure of a character's or organization's relative power in society.
    In most medieval societies, a character is born into a certain social class and will remain within that class.
    Still, those of noble rank (SC 3 or higher) can generally promote others to any rank below their own
    or demote anyone who is below their own rank.
</p>
<p>
    Which other privileges, responsibilities, laws, etc. that apply to each rank will typically vary from society to society.
    For example, some societies may only allow those above SC 1 to own and carry weapons.
</p>
<p>
    Social Class of an organization is a reflection of its power relative to nobles and other
    individuals as well as to other organizations.
    The leader or leaders of an organization will often have SC equal to the organization's,
    but other members typically have lower SC.
</p>

<h4 id="WealthClass">Wealth Class</h4>
<p>
    Wealth Class is a somewhat abstract measure of a character's, organization's, or community's wealth.
    It represents access to assets, incomes, and resources rather than being a simple pile of coins and possessions.
    This means that WC of 1 or higher generates a certain amount of income every day.
    In most societies, a high WC will also make it easier to borrow money from other wealthy individuals and organizations.
</p>

<h4 id="Reputation">Reputation</h4>
<p>
    An individualâ€™s 
    <a href="hb02_coremech.php#Reputation">reputation</a> 
    will affect other peopleâ€™s attitudes and may give bonuses or penalties to certain action checks
    (Psychology skill checks in particular). Note that a reputation will only have an effect on people who know and believe in the reputation.
    It is up to the DM to decide whether a reputation should apply to an action check, and also whether it should be a bonus or penalty.
    In general, a reputation should be a benefit more often than a hindrance.
</p>
<p>
    When you apply a reputation to an action check, you should generally use one half or one third of the reputation as a modifier,
    although the actual fraction is ultimately up to the DM.
    When multiple reputations apply to the same check, start with one half or one third of the highest of them,
    and then add 20% or 25% of the remaining ones.
    It is also possible for one reputation to counteract or lessen another one.
</p>

<h4 id="Influence">Influence</h4>
<p>
    <a href="hb02_coremech.php#Influence">Influence</a> 
    is a measure of your power over another individual or an organization. This power can be used to request favors,
    mobilize military forces, gather economic resources, etc.
</p>
<p>
    In many ways, an influence check can be used to achieve effects similar to those you achieve with Psychology-based skill checks.
    However, while the Psychology checks try to improve the targetâ€™s attitude towards you,
    an influence check instead tries to force the target to help you (for reasons of duty or debt).
</p>
<p>
    Influence can also be used to determine the effects and results of power struggles within an organization.
    Assume, for example, that a lieutenant in a thievesâ€™ guild assassinates his boss.
    If there are no other members with a higher or similar level of influence, he can then easily take over the guild.
    On the other hand, if several members have similar levels of influence, internal warfare is likely to ensue.
