<h5>Welcome to the RoL d20 role-playing system!</h5>

<p>
    This set of role-playing rules is based on the 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_system">d20 system</a> and 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">3.5E D&amp;D</a>,
    with some additional inspiration from other d20 systems as well as 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">4E D&amp;D</a> and
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">5E D&amp;D</a>.
    The RoL rules have been designed to be simpler and more flexible, but also more realistic, than the original rules.
    However, the set of classes, character races, monsters, spells, and so forth are basically the same, and the RoL rules try to remain 
    faithful to the heroic and high-fantasy feel of traditional D&amp;D.
